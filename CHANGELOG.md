# Changelog

## 1.2.3 - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Dashboard model configuration now treats a saved model context window as the
  current project's local context budget, so the composer context limit and
  automatic compaction budget stay aligned with the configured model window.
- Saving model configuration while a turn is running no longer resets the
  Dashboard context badge to `0`; existing prompt/context usage is preserved
  while the updated configured limit is displayed.
- Idle Dashboard sessions rebuild their context window after model/config
  changes while retaining existing compaction summary metadata.
- Automatic context compaction now defaults to the configured context window
  itself instead of a hidden ratio, and the byte fallback budget follows larger
  token windows unless explicitly overridden.
- Resuming a compacted session no longer expands archived full context when the
  restored prompt would immediately exceed the configured context budget; Ant
  Code keeps the compacted summary active instead.
- Background terminal tasks can now be listed and cancelled by model tools,
  allowing agents to reuse or recycle an existing server/viewer before starting
  a replacement.
